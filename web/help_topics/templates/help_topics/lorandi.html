          <p>Undoubtedly the most determined of the kinships, the Lorandi made their way all the way to the south,
              over the bleak mountains and they were rewarded for their diligence. For when they crested the peaks,
              they found an endless field of harvest. Waving grasslands welcomed them, and enveloped their very way
              of life. Gluttony, greed, and a hoarding of sorts took over this people of plenty. Obsession over
              dominion, over plenty, became their way of life. Swift watchmen on horses were established by all the
              grassland lords to keep their domains prosperous. They became swift in all manner of the word, in
              combat and in judgement.</p>
